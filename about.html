            <h1>Description</h1>
            <pre>Hello There! My name is Ayush Sarkar, and I’m embarking on an exciting journey as a first-year student in the B-Tech program in Computer Science and Engineering,
                 with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at TIUT (Techno India University of Tripura). Based in Agartala, Tripura,
                  I’m thrilled to be part of a vibrant academic community where I can immerse myself in the latest advancements in technology.
                                                                 
                                                                    
                                                                      
                With a passion for solving complex problems and a keen interest in the transformative power of AI and ML,
                 I’m eager to delve into various aspects of these fields. From exploring innovative algorithms to developing intelligent systems, 
                 I’m committed to leveraging my education to make meaningful contributions to technology and society.
                                                                  
                                                                     
                                                                         
                When I’m not buried in code or tackling machine learning models, you’ll find me exploring the tech landscape, 
                participating in hackathons, and staying updated with the latest trends in AI.
                 I’m looking forward to connecting with like-minded individuals and industry professionals as I navigate this exciting phase of my academic and professional journey.

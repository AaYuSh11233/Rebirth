            <h1>Description</h1>
            <pre>Hi there! Myself Ayush, currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

                My academic journey is driven by a deep fascination with how AI and ML can transform industries and enhance everyday life.

                Through my studies, I’m diving into advanced algorithms and innovative technologies, constantly seeking to understand and contribute to the evolving tech landscape.


                Outside of my academic pursuits, I’m passionate about gaming and anime.

                Gaming allows me to unwind and challenge myself, immersing me in diverse virtual worlds and complex problem-solving scenarios.

                Anime, on the other hand, captivates me with its rich storytelling and unique art styles, offering a creative escape and a fresh perspective on narrative and character development.

                
                In addition to these hobbies, I also enjoy developing websites in my spare time.

                Whether it’s building a personal project or working on a freelance basis, I find great satisfaction in designing and coding engaging web experiences.
                
                This side work not only sharpens my technical skills but also lets me express my creativity in a tangible way.
                

                Balancing my studies, hobbies, and side projects keeps me motivated and excited about the future.
                
                I’m eager to leverage my skills in AI and ML, along with my passion for gaming, anime, and web development,
                
                to make meaningful contributions to technology and create innovative solutions that can impact the world.
